- **T1070.004 - File Deletion**: ⚠️ **Partial** (71% confidence)
- **T1027 - Obfuscated Files**: ❌ **Not Detected** (0% confidence)

## Key Findings

### Strengths in Detection Coverage
1. **PowerShell Monitoring**: Excellent coverage of PowerShell-based attacks
2. **Process Injection**: Strong detection capabilities for various injection techniques
3. **Registry Modifications**: Good visibility into persistence mechanisms

### Critical Detection Gaps
1. **Account Manipulation**: No coverage for account privilege escalation
2. **Code Obfuscation**: Limited detection of obfuscated payloads
3. **Scheduled Tasks**: Partial coverage needs improvement

## Simulation Results Summary

```
Total Techniques Simulated: 15
Fully Detected: 8 (53%)
Partially Detected: 4 (27%)
Not Detected: 3 (20%)
Overall Detection Score: 73.2%
```

## Detailed Technical Analysis

### Spearphishing Campaign Simulation
The simulation replicated APT29's typical spearphishing approach:
- **Email Vector**: COVID-19 themed attachments
- **Payload**: Cobalt Strike beacon
- **C2 Infrastructure**: Domain fronting via legitimate CDNs

**Detection Results**: Successfully detected initial payload execution but missed C2 communications due to domain fronting technique.

### Living-off-the-Land Techniques
APT29 extensively uses legitimate system tools:
- **PowerShell**: 47 distinct commands executed
- **WMI**: 12 reconnaissance queries
- **Registry**: 8 persistence modifications

**Detection Results**: Strong telemetry collection but some legitimate tool usage blended with normal activity.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Deploy additional WMI monitoring** to catch reconnaissance activities
2. **Implement behavioral analytics** for account manipulation detection
3. **Enhance PowerShell logging** with script block logging enabled

### Strategic Improvements
1. **Machine Learning Models**: Implement ML-based detection for obfuscated content
2. **User Behavior Analytics**: Deploy UEBA to catch credential abuse
3. **Network Analysis**: Add DNS monitoring for domain fronting detection

### Rule Tuning
1. **Reduce False Positives**: Current FP rate of 2.3% needs reduction to <1%
2. **Sensitivity Adjustment**: Increase sensitivity for scheduled task creation
3. **Correlation Rules**: Create multi-stage detection rules for complex attack chains

## Threat Intelligence Context

### Recent Campaigns
- **SolarWinds Supply Chain**: December 2020
- **Microsoft Exchange**: March 2021
- **COVID-19 Research**: Ongoing since 2020

### Infrastructure Patterns
- **Domain Fronting**: Primary C2 obfuscation method
- **Legitimate Services**: Abuse of cloud services for hosting
- **Certificate Abuse**: Use of valid certificates for legitimacy

## Conclusion

APT29 represents one of the most sophisticated threat actors currently active. Our detection coverage of 73.2% is above industry average but requires improvement in several key areas. The group's use of living-off-the-land techniques and sophisticated evasion methods continues to challenge traditional signature-based detection approaches.

## Next Steps

1. **Weekly Review**: Schedule weekly analysis of APT29 TTPs
2. **Red Team Exercise**: Plan advanced red team simulation
3. **Tool Integration**: Evaluate additional detection tools
4. **Training**: Conduct analyst training on APT29 indicators
