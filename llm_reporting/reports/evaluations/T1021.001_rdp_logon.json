  "evaluation": "- **Short Summary**: This Sigma rule aims to detect successful Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) logon attempts, which are often associated with lateral movement by attackers in an intrusion scenario. The detection relies on the presence of Event ID 4624 and LogonType value indicating interactive logons via RDP.\n\n- **MITRE ATT&CK Techniques**: This rule primarily corresponds to MITRE's techniques T1059 (Remote Desktop Protocol) or BANNER/ADVERTISEMENT of Remote Services and potentially the initial access phase if these logon attempts are traced back as part of reconnaissance by an attacker.\n\n- **Severity Level**: Medium - RDP login success is a significant indicator that should warrant investigation, but it doesn't always directly lead to data breaches without additional context or actions taken after the initial access.\n\n- **Detection Quality and Gaps**: The rule effectively detects known patterns of an attack by focusing on Event ID 4624 related to RDP logon attempts but lacks detection for alternative login methods that could be used as part of a more sophisticated evasion technique. Additionally, the lack of context about who is logging in and from which location might hinder accurate incident analysis if further investigation was required.\n\n- **Suggestions to Improve**: The rule would benefit from additional conditions or fields that capture other login methods (e.g., SSH), user account details for tracing back activities, geolocation information to assess the legitimacy of a location claim in credential use cases, and integration with threat intelligence sources which could help distinguish between false positives/benign activity and actual attack patterns based on known bad actors or IPs.\n\n- **Missing Log Sources**: The rule considers Windows Event logs as its primary log source for detecting RDP login attempts through Security event ID 4624; however, it could benefit from incorporating system audit logs (Security-auditing), network device logs like firewall or router access control lists changes that might indicate unauthorized port usage.\n\nTo summarize the rule's effectiveness: It has good specificity for detecting RDP logons but requires broader context to accurately determine threat level and may miss alternative credential use scenarios; thus, it could be enhanced by including more comprehensive detection criteria and additional sources of information that might assist with attribution or the establishment of a timeline.",
